Task

Objective:

As a MERN stack developer, you will be creating a basic frontend and backend for a generative AI project that generates text based on a user's input.

Frontend:

1. Create a simple web application using React or Angular that displays a text input field and a submit button.
2. When the user submits the text input, make a request to the backend API to generate text using a pre-trained generative AI model.
3. Display the generated text in a basic format, without any formatting options.

Backend:

1. Create a RESTful API using Node.js and Express.js that handles the text generation request from the frontend.
2. Use a pre-trained generative AI model (e.g., TensorFlow.js or Brain.js) to generate text based on the input provided by the user.
3. Implement a simple API endpoint to handle the text generation request and return the generated text.

Additional Requirements:

1. Implement a basic caching mechanism to reduce the number of API requests.
2. Use a public dataset such as the BookCorpus or the OpenWebText Corpus to train the generative AI model.

Evaluation Criteria:

1. Frontend development: ease of use and basic functionality
2. Backend development: API design, generative AI model implementation, and performance
3. Integration: seamless integration between frontend and backend components

Timeline:

This is an 8 hour task. Please submit your project by Friday End of the day, as a single ZIP file containing the frontend and backend code, as well as a brief written report detailing your approach and design decisions.

Note:

Please ensure that your project is well-organized, concise, and easy to understand. You are encouraged to include relevant code comments and explanations to support your submission. If you have any questions or concerns, please feel free to reach out to us.
